## Introduction

In this document, we explore advanced ensemble techniques such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. We will review their theoretical foundations, implement models, and evaluate their performance on real-world datasets.

## Theory Review

Summarize the theoretical foundations. For instance, the boosting process can be expressed mathematically as follows:

\[
F(x) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \alpha_m h_m(x)
\]

where \( F(x) \) is the final model, \( \alpha_m \) is the weight of the \( m \)-th model, and \( h_m(x) \) is the \( m \)-th weak learner.

## Implementation

- **XGBoost**: Implementation steps for XGBoost.
- **LightGBM**: Implementation steps for LightGBM.
- **CatBoost**: Implementation steps for CatBoost.

## Experimentation

Describe the datasets and benchmarking. For instance, compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy (\( \text{Acc} \)), precision (\( \text{Prec} \)), and recall (\( \text{Rec} \)).

\[
\text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Prec} \times \text{Rec}}{\text{Prec} + \text{Rec}}
\]

## Analysis

Evaluate efficiency and scalability. Discuss findings in terms of training time, model accuracy, and resource utilization.

## Conclusion

Summarize key findings, comparing the performance of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, and provide any conclusions.
